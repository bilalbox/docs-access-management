To view your SAML response in a browser, perform a single sign-on and use the developer tools in your browser to find the bearer token and SAML response.

[NOTE]
Complete this task before calling the MuleSoft Support team to assist you in troubleshooting your SAML 2.0 compliant SSO setup. 

. Open a new tab in your browser and open Chrome Developer Tools, Firebug for Firefox, or a SAML tracer to capture the SAML response.
. From Anypoint Platform, click *Access Management* -> *Organizations* -> _yourMasterOrg_, and copy the domain name.
. Go to `anypoint.mulesoft.com/accounts/login/_domain_name_`. This will redirect you to your IDPâ€™s Single sign on page. 
. Enter the IDP account credentials and authenticate yourself.
. In the Chrome developer tool *Form data* window, select the *Params* tab. Other tools or tracers may have different labels.
. Record the SAML response element.

After recording the SAML response element, use it to xref:access-management::saml-bearer-token.adoc[obtain a bearer token] to access platform APIs. It is also useful to provide the SAML response for troubleshooting when contacting MuleSoft support.

. Log in to the MuleSoft Support Portal at the following URL:

. Provide a screen shot of your SAML configuration in Anypoint Platform.
. Include an XML SAML assertion.

Google Chrome version 79 stores the SAML response in the *Network* tab.
In the *Network* tab, a line indicating you logged in to Anypoint Platform is shown.
You can expand the line that notes your login and access form data that is relevant to your SAML response element.
