The Connected Apps feature provides a framework that enables an external application to integrate with Anypoint Platform using https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/exchange/portals/anypoint-platform/[APIs] through OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect.
Connected apps help users delegate their access without sharing sensitive credentials or giving full control of their accounts to third parties.
Actions taken by connected apps are audited, and users can also revoke access at any time.
Note that some products do not currently include client IDs in this release of the Connected Apps feature.
The Connected Apps feature enables you to use secure authentication protocols and control an app's access to user data. Additionally, end users can authorize the app to access their Anypoint Platform data.

== Authentication

Anypoint Platform supports OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect to authorize apps to access data within Anypoint Platform.
OAuth (Open Authorization) is an open protocol that provides secure API authorization from applications in a simple and standardized way.
OAuth 2.0 can authorize access to resources without revealing user credentials to apps.
OpenID Connect identifies the end user and obtains information to pass to OAuth 2.0 connected apps.

The Connected Apps feature uses OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect, or _OIDC_, as part of its authentication process. OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect flows must be completed in order to grant access to Anypoint APIs only to services and users that have the proper permissions. 

OAuth 2.0
When understanding OAuth 2.0, an authorization protocol, we must first define several key terms to ground our understanding. The first is the client, which refers to the resource that wants the data and could be a computer or server. Next, the authorization server refers to the server that can authorize, and the resource server refers to the system with the data. The access token is the key to get into data in the resource server and the redirect URI is where you go if the user or service authorizes the other service.

There are two types of flows for OAuth 2.0. 

The first is the authorization_code flow. In this flow, the client goes to the authorization server and and the server pops up a window asking for authorization for specific scopes from the user. If the user authorizes the client to have this information, an authorization code is sent the redirect URI. The redirect URI then exchanges the authorization code for an access token from the authorization server which is then taken to the resource server to obtain the data by talking to a specific API. This is called an application acting on behalf of the user.

The second flow is the client_credentials flow. In this flow, each piece is very similar but instead of a user authorizing the application, the application can authorize on its own behalf. This is also called a service-to-service use case.


=== OpenID Connect (OIDC)

OICD is an authentication protocol that authenticates users. This identity layer sits on top of the OAuth 2.0 protocol and provides authentication as opposed to the authorization OAuth 2.0 provides.


For more information, see https://oauth.net/2/[OAuth 2.0] and https://openid.net/connect/[OpenID Connect].

== Access and Authorization

You can use the Connected Apps feature to create a seamless authentication experience for end users. Connected apps address use cases for the following types of users:

* An xref:connected-apps-org-admin.adoc[organization administrator] can control how their organizationâ€™s data is used by whitelisting apps, revoking access, and disabling this feature for the entire organization.
* An xref:connected-apps-developers.adoc#developers[organization administrator who is developing a connected app] can register new (and manage existing) apps within their organization.
* An xref:connected-apps-end-users.adoc#end-users[end user] can authorize apps to access particular information, such as viewing assets in Anypoint Exchange.
